   - Person, employee, patient
3. Method override
   - assignPatientToRoom() – Assigns a patient to an available room.
   - checkRoomAvailability() – Checks if a room is available.
   - releaseRoom() – Marks a room as free when a patient is discharged.
 4. Method overloading
   -
 5. Interfaces/ Abstract classes
   -  (e.g., RoomManagementInterface) and abstract classes that enforce structure across room types.
 6. Conditional operation (if-else/switch-case)
    -
 7. Loop
    - 
 8. Exception handling
    -
 9. Files I/O
